## Welcome

A very warm welcome and thanks for your kind participation in this "Spiritual" ceremony.  What we are trying to do  here is kinda bring some good vibes and inspirations from some of the oldest  `Sanskrit` poetry, and also adapt the intent to a somewhat modern perspective. I will give you a little more context in next couple of minutes and thereafter we have recital of seven Vaidik verses. 

## Thanks

Before I lay out the context, I have special thanks for Henry's family, and freinds, for hosting us here in beautiful South of France - Montpellier. 

I also want to thank all the international travelers who have flown across timezones to be here in person. Your presence makes it even more beautiful. 

I also want to applaud the bride and the groom, Doctor Aakriti and Doctor Henry, two scientists, for showing keen interest in our spiritual traditions. This interest indicates that our traditions and our values are in the foundations of science. So cogratulations to both of you - Aakriti and Henry -  and also thanks for entrusting me this very important ceremony.

## Context

When we started thinking about this wedding, at the outset, we all wanted a spiritual ceremony; but without too many formalities. Both Henry and Aakriti felt, (they wanted) the ceremony to be meaningful and succinct - kinda short and sweet - a tough ask. The curious quetion then was to ascertain a befitting ceremony that truly  represented this beautiful cross cultural union. 

The obvious rationale was to look at the Vaidik scriptures - because being among the oldest written documents, they are beyond any religion, race or color. They are by default spritual - just like this beautiful unification of two cultures.

When I looked up, I found in `Rig Veda`, the oldest of four `Vedas`, there is a complete chapter dedicated to the ritual of wedding - `Paani grahna` as we call it in `Sanskrit`. It describes a wedding through an example. The `Paanigrahana` ceremony of the Moon  `Soma` with Sun's daughter `Surya` -  two mythical characters. The wedding procession that you saw earlier this afternoon, bears it's roots in this chapter of `Rig Veda`. When `Soma` went to seek `Surya's` hand in marriage, his friends and family celebrated the occasion, dancing around their chariot. It is almost seven thousand years old tradition - give or take!

So, I have chosen few verses from this primordial wedding. A wedding registered in `Rigveda` itself. The first fully documented wedding.  And I have taken the liberty to add few of my own choices. I hope you will find them relevant. 

## Process

The way we are going to do it is, I will request `Uggah` to provide a quick synopsis for the fench audience and then I will recite the verses with English translation. We will also request the bride and the groom to take a circle of the candles with each verse. The circle around the fire has a deeper meaning ..  but for now its a signature. Its a signature that both the bride and the groom fully understand , appreciate and approve the recital. After seven circles of auspecious bonds, the bride and the groom will have their vows, in their own words, to transition into the role of a "husband" and a "wife"!

## Permission

< Check for questions>

If there are no questions, let us get started with your kind blessings.

### Invocation 

The first verse is a wish from all of us present here for this beautiful union at this beautiful location. 


It says

> Ihemavindra Samnudam Chakravakev Dampati;
>
> Prajyouno Swastikou Vismayurvya Ashnutaam.

O Lord, may you bring this couple together, like a pair of `Charavaka` birds. `Chakravaka` is a duck. In India we call it a `Brahmini` duck. Which means a sacred duck.

So Hey lord, please bring this couple together like a pair of `Chakravaka` ducks. Let them enjoy the marital bliss and live a long life along with their progeny. Their kids , and of course their pets :-)

> Involve the audience (optional) - Since it is a wish from all of us, I would need a representative of the audience to say these words with me. Any volunteers ? Have MB represent as a member of the audience to repeat the verse. And then seek acceptance from Aakriti and Henry and ask the to take a circle of the fire while  chanting the `Mantra`

Henry should go first as he already brought a pet this union. 

> Well begun is half done. Stage a time check. 

### What is Paanigrahana.

Talking about traditions, weddings - or `Paanigrahna` , as we call it `Sanskrit`, is one of the oldest and among the most sacred tradition ... in almost all the culture. Since it is a universal tradition, it is by definition, spiritual. Spirituality is something that goes beyond, the man made differences.  Something omnipresent across all the cultures. Thus weddings are spiritual events. The word `Paani grahna` aptly captures this essence. It simply means two partners, accepting each other's hand. Two partners holding each other's hand , irrespective of their orientations or affiliations. But it sees the union at a much higher spiritual level.

So this next verse is bride's expression of this spiritual love. This is how she views this union. It says 

> Dhairham Prithvitvam;
>
> Ratoham, ratobritvam;
>
> Manohamsmi Vaaktvam;
>
> Saamasmi Rikarvam;
>
> Sa Mam, Anuvrata bhav.

It is beautiful `Sanskrit` poetry and the meaning is equally powerful. It means

I am the sky, you are the earth;

I radiate energy and you hold it to manifest things in this physical world;

I am the thought (`Mana`) and you are the words. 

I am `Saama` the music, and you are `Rika` the song

I and you follow each other. 


So Aakriti, if you understood the meaning of `Paani Granha`, then you may lead  Henry for a circle around the fire.

# Conclude

The chapter of `Rigveda` that I spoke about `Sookta eighty five` of tenth book of `Rigveda` , was spoken by `Maharishi Surya` a saint that respresented the Sun. In a way these verses came from the father of the bride when he described the wedding after the fact. That made me aware of my responsibility as a bridal dad. If a father could write an entire chapter of Rigveda to celebrate his daughter's wedding, least I could do was to recite few verses from this epic.
