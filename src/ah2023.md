# Welcome

A very warm welcome and thanks for joining this "Spiritual" ceremony.  What we are doining here is kinda bring some good vibes and inspirations from some of the oldest  Sanskrit poetry. I will give you a little more context in next five or so minutes and thereafter we have recital of seven Vaidik verses. 

# Thanks

Before I lay out the context, I have special thanks for Henry's family, and freinds, for hosting us here in beautiful South of France - Montpellier. I also want to thank all the international travelers who have flown across timezones to be here in person. Your presence makes it even more beautiful. I also want to applaud the bride and the groom, Doctor Aakriti and Doctor Henry, two scientists, for showing keen interest in our spiritual traditions. This interest indicates that our traditions and our values are in the foundations of science. So cogratulations to both of you and thanks for entrusting me this very important ceremony.

# Context

When we started thinking about the ceremoney, both Henry and Aakriti felt that the ceremony should be meaningful and succinct. We also wanted some undershades of spiritituality. The curious quetion was to ascertain a befitting ceremony that also represented this cross cultural union. The obvious rationale was to look at the Vaidik scriptures - because being the oldest written texts these scriptures are beyond any religion, race or color - just like this beautiful union of two cultures.

When I looked up, I found in `Rig Veda`, the oldest of all scriptures, there is a complete chapter dedicated to a wedding - `Paani grahna` as we call it in `Sanskrit`. It describes a wedding through an example. The wedding of moon  `Soma` and son's daughter `Surya`. Two mythical characters. So I have chosen few verses from this primordial wedding. A wedding registered in the oldest scripture. 

And I have taken the liberty to add few of my own choices. I hope you will find them relevant. 

The way we are going to do it is, I will request `Uggah` to provide a quick synopsis for the fench audience and then I will bring you the verses with English translation. We will also request the bride and the groom to take a circle of the fire with each verse. The circle around the fire has a deeper meaning but for now its a signature. Its a signature that both the bride and the groom fully understand , appreciate and approve the recital. After seven circles of auspecious bondage, the bride and the groom will have their vows in their own words.
