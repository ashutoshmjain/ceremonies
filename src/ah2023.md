## Welcome

A very warm welcome and thanks for your kind participation in this "Spiritual" ceremony.  What we are trying to do  here is kinda bring some good vibes and inspirations from some of the oldest  `Sanskrit` poetry, and also adapt the intent to a somewhat modern perspective. I will give you a little more context in next couple of minutes and thereafter we have recital of seven Vaidik verses. 

## Thanks

Before I lay out the context, I have special thanks for Henry's family, and freinds, for hosting us here in beautiful South of France - Montpellier. I also want to thank all the international travelers who have flown across timezones to be here in person. Your presence makes it even more beautiful. I also want to applaud the bride and the groom, Doctor Aakriti and Doctor Henry, two scientists, for showing keen interest in our spiritual traditions. This interest indicates that our traditions and our values are in the foundations of science. So cogratulations to both of you - Aakriti and Henry -  and also thanks for entrusting me this very important ceremony.

## Context

When we started thinking about this wedding, both Henry and Aakriti felt, (they wanted) the ceremony to be meaningful and succinct - kinda short and sweet. We also wanted few undershades of spiritituality  - without too many formalities - a tough ask. The curious quetion then was to ascertain a befitting ceremony that also represented this beautiful cross cultural union. The obvious rationale was to look at the Vaidik scriptures - because being the oldest written documents they are beyond any religion, race or color - just like this beautiful unification of two cultures.

When I looked up, I found in `Rig Veda`, the oldest of four `Vedas`, there is a complete chapter dedicated to the ritual of wedding - `Paani grahna` as we call it in `Sanskrit`. It describes a wedding through an example. The `Paanigrahana` ceremony of the Moon  `Soma` with Son's daughter `Surya` -  two mythical characters. So, I have chosen few verses from this primordial wedding. A wedding registered in `Rigveda` itself. The first fully documented wedding.

And I have taken the liberty to add few of my own choices. I hope you will find them relevant. 

## Process

The way we are going to do it is, I will request `Uggah` to provide a quick synopsis for the fench audience and then I will bring you the verses with English translation. We will also request the bride and the groom to take a circle of the candles with each verse. The circle around the fire means like forging the essence of the verse into a material action! It has a deeper meaning ..  but for now its a signature. Its a signature that both the bride and the groom fully understand , appreciate and approve the recital. After seven circles of auspecious bondage, the bride and the groom will have their vows in their own words, to transition into the role of a "husband" and "wife".

## Permission

< Check for questions>

If there are no questions, let us get started with your kind blessings.

### Invocation 

I humbly seek permission from all the well wishers and witnesses gathered here. In fact the first verse is a wish from all of us present here for this beautiful union at this beautiful location.
