## Weddings are Spiritual.
Marriage or `पाणिग्रहण` (`Paanigrahana` — as we call it in Sanskrit) is one of the oldest and sacred tradition in almost all the cultures. Since it is in all cultures, it is obviously beyond religions or nation states. `Paanigrahna` simply means two partners accepting or holding each other's hand — irrespective of their orientations or affiliations. Since it is a universal tradition, it is by definition spiritual. Spirituality means something that is present beyond the man made barriers — something omnipresent. In a way, weddings are by definition, spiritual events by virtue of their being omnipresent across cultures.

### Weddings are the gateway to the family.
In every culture, family is seen as the cradle to spirituality. Family is the place to hone fine emotions of love, care, respect and sacrifice that define the fabric of spirituality.  And in almost every culture, weddings are the gateway to the “family”. Now there are different ways to conduct the wedding ceremonies, but more importantly it’s a commitment to look out for each other. Even if there is no ceremony, the spiritual sense is to stand by each other through thick and thin — holding each other’s hand — `Paanigrahana`.

### `Vaidik` Wedding ceremony
When we think about a spiritual way to conduct a wedding ceremony, The obvious choice is to look at `Vedic` scriptures. Being the oldest written text, they are from a time before these barriers (of religion, race, color or nations) even came into being. They, by default, represent spirituality. `Rig Veda` — the oldest of four Vedas — has a complete chapter dedicated to the idea of wedding. It describes a wedding through an example — the marriage of Soma and Surya — two mythical characters. It is the first fully documented wedding - a wedding registered in `Rig Veda` itself. 

These verses from those primordial texts, bring the best of `Sanskrit` poetry in expressing the essence of a spiritual union. And they seem relevant even today.

The first verse is to mark the beginning of the wedding ceremony. It is a blessing from all those present for this beautiful union.

> इहेमाविन्द्र सं नुद चक्रवाकेव दम्पती ।
>
> प्रजयौनौ स्वस्तकौ विस्वमायुर्व्यऽशनुताम् ॥

O Lord ! May you bring together this newly married couple in the same manner as a pair of `Chakravaka` birds. `Chakravaka` is a duck. In India, we call it a `Brahmini` duck, which means a sacred duck.  

Let them enjoy marital bliss, and along with their kids, live a full life.

The second verse is about the bride’s expression love. This is how she views this union. She believes that marriage in itself is a universe. She and the groom are two halves of the “entirety”.

>धैरहं पृथिवीत्वम् ।
>
>रेतोऽहं रेतोभृत्त्वम् ।
>
>मनोऽहमस्मि वाक्त्वम् ।
>
>सामाहमस्मि ऋकृत्वम् ।
>
>सा मां अनुव्रता भव ।


I am the sky and you are the earth. 

I radiate life energy and you hold it to manifest things. 

I am the mind and you are the word. 

I am `Saama` — the music, and you are the Song — `Rrik`. 

You and I follow each other.

In the third verse, the bride wishes for a long union. She trusts the groom for his foresight ..

> तच्चक्षु॑र्दे॒वहि॑तं शु॒क्रमु॒च्चर॑त् |
>
> पश्ये॑म श॒रद॑: श॒तं, जीवे॑म श॒रद॑: श॒तम् ॥


Your auspicious foresight (in this union) is bright and rising. 

May we see it together for a hundred winters; may we live a hundred years. (RV 7.66.16 Vasishtha)

In the fourth verse, the groom commits to be a caring partner to the bride.

> धर्मेच अर्थेच कामेच इमां नातिचरामि ।
>
> धर्मेच अर्थेच कामेच इमं नातिचरामि ॥

In my duty, in my financial commitments, in my needs, I will consult you. 

I will take your consent and act upon. 

----

In the fifth verse, the groom now thanks the Gods for bringing the bride into his life.

> गृभ्णामि ते सौभगत्वाय हस्तं मया पत्या जरदष्टिर्यथासः ।
>

> सखा सप्तपदा भव ।
>
> सखायौ सप्तपदा बभूव ।
